<p> Hello everyone. First of all, thanks a lot to the Jonathan Mcglone's blog " Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub" (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#). 
<br>
I found there everything I needed to construct this guide and I hope it will help you to be able to create your own Github profile. Let's do it: </p>
				<br>
			<h2> 1. Create a Github profile. </h2>
<p> - Go to the Github homepage (www.github.com) and tap the "sign up" button. You will have to give your email account and create a username and a password.</p>

<br>
<h2> 2. Sign in with your new profile. </h2>

<p> - Once you have created your profile, you have to sign in with your email account and password.</p>

<h2> 3. Create your personal repository. </h2>

<p> - After signing in, tap on the "repositories" button in your profile. Once there, you will be able to tap on the "new" button and upload a new screen, where you will have to choose your file name</p>
<br>

<br> 
<p> - Select as name "your_profile_name.github.io" as the repository name. For example, as my profile is tfmeyermunoz, my repository name is "tfmeyermunoz.github.io".
	After that, choose if you want to have a README file to describe the repository and a gitignore file, to be able to ignore some of the files in your repository. </p>

<h2> 4. Upload the files youn want to show. </h2>
<br>

- Once you have created your profile, you have to sign in with your email account and password.

<h2> 5. Create your index.html file </h2>
<br>

- Once you have created your profile, you have to sign in with your email account and password.

<h2> 6. See your results. </h2>

<h3> - Once you have created your profile, you have to sign in with your email account and password.</h3>

<h2> 6. Troubleshooting. </h2>

<h3> - Once you have created your profile, you have to sign in with your email account and password.</h3>
