<p> Hello everyone. First of all, thanks a lot to the Jonathan Mcglone's blog " Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub" (http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#). 
<br>
I found there everything I needed to construct this guide and I hope it will help you to be able to create your own Github profile. Let's do it: </p>
				<br>
			<h2> 1. Create a Github profile. </h2>
<p> - Go to the Github homepage (www.github.com) and tap the "sign up" button on the right corner of the screen. You will have to give your email account and create a username and a password.</p>
				<br>

<br>
<h2> 2. Sign in with your new profile. </h2>

<p> - Once you have created your profile, you have to sign in with your email account and password.</p>
<br>

<h2> 3. Create your personal repository. </h2>

<p> - After signing in, tap on the "repositories" button in your profile. Once there, you will be able to tap on the "new" button and upload a new screen, where you will have to choose your file name</p>
<br>
<img src="../github_3.jpg" alt="University" width="544" height="360"/>
<br> 
<p> - Select as name "your_profile_name.github.io" as the repository name. For example, as my profile is tfmeyermunoz, my repository name is "tfmeyermunoz.github.io".
<br> 
After that, choose if you want to have a README file to describe the repository and a gitignore file, to be able to ignore some of the files in your repository. </p>

<h2> 4. Upload the files youn want to show. </h2>
<br>

<p>- Once you have created your personal repository, you will have to create your homepage. If you want to upload any picture or file to be able to use it as part of your homepage, you will have to do the following: </p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>1. Tap the "Add file" button.</li>
<li>2. Select the "Upload files" alternative.</li>
<li>3. Navigate through your computer and upload the files you need in your repository. For example, a profile picture.</li>
	<li>4. Commit your changes. </li>
			</ul>
<br>

<br>		
<h2> 5. Create your index.html file </h2>
<br>

<p>- In your repositories homepage, tap the "Add file" button and then click on "Create new file". After that, follow these instructions:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>1. Select "index.html" as file name.</li>
<li>2. Create your profile as you wish. It is highly recommended to create a title and include a picture.</li>
<li>3. Commit the changes.</li>
			</ul>
<br>

<br>			
<p>- For example, in the picture above, I have already created a standard layour for my personal page, to be able to use it in multiple cases without repeating work. </p>
			
<h2> 6. See your results. </h2>
<br>
<p> - Once you have commited the changes, you can go to your_profile_name.github.io and see your results.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p> - As shown in the picture, you will be able to create an interactive profile and try to make it as attractive as possible </p>
			
<h2> Final remarks </h2>
