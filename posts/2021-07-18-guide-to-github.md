Well. I'm trying alternatives to create my first post. I followd the instructions found in a Guide and powered it by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
Note the file extension .md stands for Markdown, and the Markdown syntax used inside the file gets converted to HTML by Jekyll. Like Wikitext, Markdown is a markup language with a syntax closer to plain text. 
The idea of Markdown is to get out of the author's way so they can write their HTML content quickly, making Markdown very suitable as a blog authoring syntax.
