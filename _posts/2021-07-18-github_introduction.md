Hello everyone. First of all, thanks a lot to the Jonathan Mcglone's blog " Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub"(http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#).
I found there everything I needed to construct this guide and I hope it will help you to be able to create your own Github profile. Let's do it:

1. Create a Github profile.
- Go to the Github homepage (www.github.com) and tap the "sign up" button.

2. Sign in with your new profile.
